== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Supported Gateways =

The plugin supports several gateways right out of the gate. In all honesty, we pick the first few ones we could find.
If your prefered gateway is not currently supported, raise a new topic topic in the forum, with its name and url, and we will do our best to integrate it into the plugin for you.
Or you can quickly shoot us a mail at support@appsbay.xyz

= The Minimum PHP Required =

The plugins make use of some cutting-edge features of the PHP Language, so yeah, we currently support 7.2 and above. Besides, some of the integrated gateways demand the use of higher versions of the PHP.
Finally, we think it is in your best interest to upgrade. You get to have the speed and added security at little to no cost.
If you are having trouble upgrading, maybe we can help. Shoot us a mail at support@appsbay.xyz

= The Minimum Browser Required =
To stay on the cutting edge, we have to use the best and the greatest tools available right now.
And this decision was made easy for us when we considered that AP SMS Manager is not meant to be used directly
by your users.
This plugin is meant for you, the site owner.

And we decided that instead of bloating the codebase with extra fluffy browser-backward polyfills, we would
rather encourage you to use some of the most modern browsers today. Like Chrome, Firefox, etc. This means, no,
this plugin is not being supported in Internet Exploral*s

= Further Question =
We believe we will know more about how you use this plugin in the coming days, and such, we will keep updating
this FAQs.

In the meantime, do not hesitate to make known your concerns, use-cases, bug reports, features suggestions, etc
